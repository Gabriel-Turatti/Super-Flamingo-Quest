Secret bars! (as if 5 health and 5 mana bars weren't enough)

--- Soul bar
If you have 0 health in all 5 bars, your soul becomes vulnerable.
All damage will be dealt directly to your soul unless you have any of the other 5 quests to protect it.
If you reach 0 soul, game over.

--- Voice bar
Used to cast powerful spells
Shards of voice are REALLY rare to find (only 9 shards in the entire game?)
Recovers voice by consuming all 5 health bars and all 5 mana bars.
Maybe use it as extra health? or do it separetely...

--- World bar
Used to cast spells
Recovers by killing enemies
does it have shards??? what to do? (undecided)
